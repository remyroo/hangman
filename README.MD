# Hangman
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/hangman)

A basic console hangman game.

The user can start a new game where they try to guess the secret word before using 8 incorrect tries.

The user can also save a game and load it later to pick up where they left off.

To play, run `ruby lib/main.rb`.

*TODO:* Make it pretty.
